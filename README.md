# VBA-Automated-rent-record-excel-sheet
In this project I have automated the excel sheet for letting agency with the help of visual basic analysis. 
With the help of this codes one can keep the tenant's payment record for each month. Whether the tenat paid the full amount or owes the balance when a check box clicked. One can make the changes through 'My macros' tab button if the tenant move out or the new tenant move in. Also the complete excel sheet can be reset for the next month. It helps day to day work more easier."
